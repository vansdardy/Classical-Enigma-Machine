/**
 * Usually, the Germans would keep a set of 3 to 7 rotors to use according to a table
 * which tells them what rotors to use and in which order they are supposed to be put into the machine.
 * 
 * This allows consistence throughout the military by having a dedicated box
 * to keep standardized rotors.
 * 
 * However, the rotors as described can be rewired freely, so it really just only offers a container.
 * 
 * Note that: A different order of the same rotors can produce different results of encryption, 
 * and the same order of the same rotors can still produce different results, as they can be placed
 * in different starting alphabets.
 * 
 * The assembly of the rotors are rather free in the Enigma machine.
